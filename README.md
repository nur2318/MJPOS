# HipPOS
(some dumb thing by [fat-tire](https://www.twitter.com/fat__tire))

It's hip.  It's for POS.  It's HipPOS, a very basic Android app intended for accessing [Webswing](http://webswing.org) web UIs such as the [floreantpos](http://floreant.org/) point-of-sale app accessed per the method outlined [here](http://fat-tire.github.io/floreantpos.html).

Technically, it's pretty-much just a single-screen [WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html).  This was written by request for people who wanted something without the menu bar and more control of the viewport.

Swipe from the left for settings.  Unaffiliated with floreant.  GPL'd.  Enjoy.
